      <h2>SUBMIT YOUR CONTRACT</h2>
      <p>Before submitting the contract, please make sure you contract is flattened. Flatten means if you have multiple contract files,
        they will be packed into one file. For example, if you are using Hardhat, open CMD or Terminal
        on your project folder, then type "npx hardhat flatten &#62; MyFlatFile.sol". This will create a flat file. Then, copy this file and paste
        it in the area below.

      <form>
          <textArea type="text" value={contractCode} onChange={ e => setContractCode(e.target.value) }></textArea>>
          <input type="submit" value="Send" className='button-87'/>
